    <p>
        I am <code>subiabre</code>. I create and write about things, mostly
        software.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is my blog, it looks and behaves like a command line, but it's just
        a regular website. You can still navigate by clicking around, but you'll
        need to type some commands to discover stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
        Like any regular shell it has input with history (<kbd>↑</kbd> &
        <kbd>↓</kbd>) and autocompletion (<kbd>Tab</kbd>). Unlike most shells
        the input is not always active, you need to focus on it, in exchange you
        get regular keyboard navigation when not on input.

    <p>Type <code>help</code> to get started.</p>
